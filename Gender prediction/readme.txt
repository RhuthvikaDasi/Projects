E-commerce service provide online shopping sites . 
To provide more efficient buying and selling experiences , a machine learning system can be applied to predict the optional organization and display of products that maximize the chance of bringing useful information to user that facilitate the online purchases.
So we propose a machine learning-based approach to predict customers' gender “Male” or “Female” from their online shopping behavior. 
We use a large dataset of online shopping behavior data from a popular Vietnam FTP group e-commerce platform and extract a set of relevant features.
We compare the performance of several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression , Gaussian Naive Bayes , Decision Tree, Random Forest models. We evaluate the models using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also compare the models using ROC curves and AUC scores..
